Hadoop with Python for streaming

* Interacting with files in the Hadoop Distributed File System with the snakebite Python module to store potentially petabytes of data
* Writing MapReduce jobs with the mrjob Python module to analyze large amounts of data over potentially thousands of nodes
* Writing MapReduce jobs with Apache Pig (a higher-level data flow language) in conjunction with Python user-defined functions

In addition to these topics, we'll briefly cover the state of Python support for other Hadoop ecosystem projects, such as HBase, Hive, Spark, Storm, Flume, Accumulo, and a few others.
